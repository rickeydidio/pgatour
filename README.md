This project folder is for working with PGA Tour data as of July 12, 2021. I wanted to see how player rankings compare across different categories such as 
money list and numerous strokes gained categories(off the tee, approach, around the green, and putting. I started with Python and different packages such as
Pandas. A lot of it mirrored my prior NBA work but I'll expand on it then add a version in SQL as well. It's basic and I learned a lot of what I used from DataCamp,
Pandas documentation, and Stack OverFlow.
